# movePlanner
Web app that dynamically displays data for a user's inputted address and city.

This project was created using jQqery. It requests data from three APIs utilizing AJAX requests and handling the returned JSON data.

This app utlizes the following APIs:

*) Google's Street View Image API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/<br />
*) The New York Time's Article Search API https://developer.nytimes.com/<br />
*) Wikipedia's Mediawiki Action API https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page<br />

The user can input a street address and city, which will result in the background of the website changing to a photo of that location. In addition, recent articles relevant to that city and wikipedia pages relevant to the city will also display.

******API Keys have been removed from the JavaScript code. Subsequent users must request and insert their own public API keys via that API's respective owner******

## This project is no longer maintained.
