# movePlanner
Website that dynamically displays data for a user's inputted address and city. 

This project was created using jQqery. It requests data from three APIs utilizing AJAX and handling mostly JSON data.



It utlizes the following APIs:

*) Google's Street View Image API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/<br />
*) The New York Time's Article Search API https://developer.nytimes.com/<br />
*) Wikipedia's Mediawiki Action API https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page<br />

User can input a street address and city, which will result in the background of the website changing to a photo of that location. In addition, recent articles relevant to that city as well as wikipedia pages relevant to the city will display.

******API Keys have been removed from the JavaScript code. Subsequent users must request and insert their own public API keys via that API's respective owner******
